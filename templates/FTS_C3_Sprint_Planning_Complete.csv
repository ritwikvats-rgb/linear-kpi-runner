FTS SPRINT PLANNING TEMPLATE - C3 (Feb 2-15 2026)
,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
SECTION 1: METHODOLOGY & DEFINITIONS,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
WHY WE USE THIS FRAMEWORK:,,,,,,,,
"This framework was designed by Utkarsh to solve the problem of tracking effort accurately.",,,,,,,,
"Previously, we estimated in weeks which didn't translate well to sprint planning.",,,,,,,,
"By using days (1 SP = 1 working day), we get:",,,,,,,,
"  1. Clear visibility into where time goes",,,,,,,,
"  2. Accurate burn-down of initiative budgets",,,,,,,,
"  3. Data-driven retros showing why spillover happens",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
CORE DEFINITIONS:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Term,Definition,Example,Why It Matters,,,,
Story Point (SP),"1 SP = 1 working day of effort for 1 person","If a task takes 3 days for 1 dev, it's 3 SP","Standardizes estimation across team",,,,
Working Days,"Business days in a cycle, excluding weekends","C3 has 10 working days (Feb 2-15)","Sets the capacity ceiling",,,,
Available SP,"Working days minus leaves and on-call deductions","10 days - 2 leave - 2 oncall backup = 6 SP","What a person can actually commit to",,,,
Roadmap Work,"Planned initiative work from quarterly roadmap","Dynamic Workflows V1, Data-Driven Cohorts","The 60% we commit to stakeholders",,,,
Adhoc Work,"Unplanned work: bugs, support, cross-pod requests","Prod hotfix, PR reviews, other pod support","The 40% buffer for reality",,,,
Initiative Budget,"Total effort allocated to a project for the quarter","Communication Module = 60 BE days for Q1","Tracks if we're on pace",,,,
Spillover,"Work committed but not completed in sprint","Committed 50 SP, completed 40 SP = 10 SP spillover","Measures planning accuracy",,,,
Delivery Rate,"Percentage of committed work completed","40 completed / 50 committed = 80%","Key performance metric",,,,
,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
SECTION 2: CAPACITY CALCULATION,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
HOW WE CALCULATE CAPACITY:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Step 1: Start with gross working days",,,,,,,,
"  - Each cycle has 10 working days",,,,,,,,
"  - Team has 12 members = 120 gross days",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Step 2: Subtract planned leaves",,,,,,,,
"  - Check leave calendar for each team member",,,,,,,,
"  - Dushyant: 1 day (Feb 2)",,,,,,,,
"  - Mayank: 3 days (Feb 4, 5, 9)",,,,,,,,
"  - Total leaves: 4 days",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Step 3: Account for on-call duties",,,,,,,,
"  WHY: On-call engineers can't commit 100% to roadmap work",,,,,,,,
"  - Primary On-Call: 40% time on incidents = 4 SP deduction",,,,,,,,
"  - Backup On-Call: 20% time on support = 2 SP deduction",,,,,,,,
"  - We have 4 on-call roles (2 BE + 2 FE) = 12 SP total deduction",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Step 4: Calculate Available SP",,,,,,,,
"  FORMULA: Available SP = Working Days - Leaves - On-Call Deduction",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
CAPACITY TABLE:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Name,Role,Working Days,Leaves,On-Call Role,On-Call Deduction,Available SP,Calculation

,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
SECTION 3: WORK ALLOCATION (60/40 SPLIT),,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
WHY 60/40 SPLIT:,,,,,,,,
"Based on historical data and team feedback:",,,,,,,,
"  - 60% is realistic for planned roadmap work",,,,,,,,
"  - 40% covers the reality of engineering work:",,,,,,,,
"    - PR reviews and code reviews",,,,,,,,
"    - Production bugs and hotfixes",,,,,,,,
"    - Cross-pod support requests",,,,,,,,
"    - Stakeholder adhoc requests",,,,,,,,
"    - On-call incident response (already deducted but buffer helps)",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
HOW WE CALCULATE:,,,,,,,,
"  Roadmap Budget = Total Available SP × 60%",,,,,,,,
"  Adhoc Budget = Total Available SP × 40%",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
ALLOCATION TABLE:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Work Type,Percentage,Formula,SP Budget,Description,,,
Roadmap (incl on-call),60%,=104 × 0.60,62,"Initiative work, features, planned deliverables",,,
Adhoc (buffer),40%,=104 × 0.40,42,"Bugs, support, PR reviews, unplanned work",,,
TOTAL,100%,,104,,,,
,,,,,,,,
BE/FE BREAKDOWN:,,,,,,,,
"Why split by BE/FE: Ensures we don't over-commit one skill type",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Work Type,BE Budget (from 80 SP),FE Budget (from 24 SP),Total,,,
Roadmap (60%),48,14,62,,,
Adhoc (40%),32,10,42,,,
Total,80,24,104,,,
,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
SECTION 4: ON-CALL ROTATION,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
WHY ON-CALL DEDUCTION:,,,,,,,,
"On-call engineers must be available for production incidents.",,,,,,,,
"They cannot commit 100% of their time to roadmap work.",,,,,,,,
"Deduction percentages based on historical incident data:",,,,,,,,
"  - Primary: ~40% of time goes to incidents/monitoring",,,,,,,,
"  - Backup: ~20% of time goes to supporting primary",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
ON-CALL SCHEDULE:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Role,C3 (Feb 2-15),C4 (Feb 16-Mar 1),C5 (Mar 2-15),C6 (Mar 16-29),,,,

================================================================================,,,,,,,,
SECTION 5: ROADMAP COMMITMENTS (62 SP BUDGET),,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
HOW INITIATIVE BURN-DOWN WORKS:,,,,,,,,
"1. Each initiative gets a Q1 budget in days (from roadmap planning)",,,,,,,,
"2. Each sprint, we commit SP to that initiative",,,,,,,,
"3. Committed SP deducts from the initiative budget",,,,,,,,
"4. We track 'Remaining' to see if we're on pace",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
EXAMPLE:,,,,,,,,
"  Data-Driven Cohorts: 10 BE days budget for Q1",,,,,,,,
"  C1 used: 3 SP",,,,,,,,
"  C2 used: 4 SP",,,,,,,,
"  C3 committing: 3 SP",,,,,,,,
"  Remaining: 10 - 3 - 4 - 3 = 0 SP (on track!)",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
WHY TRACK THIS:,,,,,,,,
"  - Prevents over-committing to one initiative",,,,,,,,
"  - Shows early if an initiative is behind schedule",,,,,,,,
"  - Helps prioritize when capacity is limited",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
INITIATIVE TRACKER:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Initiative,Q1 Budget (BE),Q1 Budget (FE),C1 Used,C2 Used,C3 Commit,Remaining,Formula

,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
SECTION 6: ADHOC BUFFER (42 SP BUDGET),,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
WHAT ADHOC COVERS:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Category,SP Allocated,Why This Amount,Who Handles
PR Reviews,10,"Every dev spends ~1 day/sprint on code reviews",All devs (rotating)
Cross-pod Support,8,"Requests from Platform, GTS, other teams",As needed
Prod Bugs/Hotfixes,8,"Urgent production issues that can't wait",On-call + available devs
Adhoc BW,10,"Stakeholder requests, urgent features",Dushyant + others
Buffer/Contingency,6,"Estimation errors, unknowns",Unallocated
TOTAL ADHOC,42,,,
,,,,,,,,
HOW TO USE ADHOC BUDGET:,,,,,,,,
"1. Don't pre-assign all adhoc SP at sprint start",,,,,,,,
"2. Track actual usage during sprint",,,,,,,,
"3. If adhoc exceeds 42 SP, roadmap work will spill",,,,,,,,
"4. Review in retro: was 40% enough? Too much?",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
SECTION 7: SPRINT EXECUTION TRACKER,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
HOW TO USE THIS TRACKER:,,,,,,,,
"1. Add all committed tickets at sprint start",,,,,,,,
"2. Update status daily or every 2 days",,,,,,,,
"3. Mark 'Completed?' as Yes when ticket is Done",,,,,,,,
"4. If not completed, fill 'Spillover Reason'",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
SPILLOVER REASONS (Standard Categories):,,,,,,,,
"  - Scope Change: Requirements changed mid-sprint",,,,,,,,
"  - Blocked: Waiting on dependency or another team",,,,,,,,
"  - Underestimation: Task was bigger than expected",,,,,,,,
"  - Resource Issue: Person on leave/sick/reassigned",,,,,,,,
"  - Priority Change: Pulled to work on something else",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,

SECTION 8: SPRINT SUMMARY & METRICS,,,,,,,,
================================================================================,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
KEY METRICS EXPLAINED:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Metric,Formula,What It Tells You,Target
Delivery Rate,Completed SP / Committed SP × 100,"How much of what we promised did we deliver?",>80%
Spillover,Committed SP - Completed SP,"How much work didn't get done?",<10 SP
Utilization,Committed SP / Available SP × 100,"Are we using our capacity well?",>90%
Roadmap Delivery,Completed Roadmap SP / Committed Roadmap SP × 100,"Are we hitting our initiative commitments?",>80%
,,,,,,,,
WHY THESE TARGETS:,,,,,,,,
"  - 80% Delivery Rate: Allows for unknowns while being accountable",,,,,,,,
"  - <10 SP Spillover: Small spillover is normal, large means planning issues",,,,,,,,
"  - >90% Utilization: Under 90% means we're not committing enough",,,,,,,,
